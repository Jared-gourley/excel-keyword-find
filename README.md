# excel-keyword-find

A simple script I made as an extension of the search feature (Ctrl+F) found in Excel.


Given a folder of Excel (.xlsx) files, this script will search every file for the given keyword and print out every found occurrence of it (as well as its location).

The search is case-insensitive.

To use, simply run main.py and make use of the UI.
